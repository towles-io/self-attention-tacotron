# Self-attention Tacotron
An implementation of "Investigation of enhanced Tacotron text-to-speech synthesis systems with self-attention for pitch accent language" https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11960

**Notice**: Our work in the paper uses a proprietary Japanese speech corpus with manually annotated labels.
Since we cannot provide a exact reproducer in public, this repository replaces dataset related codes with examples for 
publicly available corpus.


## Requirements

Python 3.6 or above is required.

This project uses Bazel as a build tool. 
This project depends on [Tacotron2](https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/tacotron2) implementation and Bazel automatically resolve the dependency with proper version.

- Python >= 3.6
- Bazel >= 0.18.0

If you are not familiar with Bazel, you can use a python command directly by setting external dependencies by yourself.
See [this document](./Bazel.md) for details.

The following python packages should be installed.

For training and prediction
- tensorflow >= 1.11
- librosa >= 0.6.1
- scipy >= 1.1.1
- matplotlib >= 2.2.2
- docopt >= 0.6.2

For test:
- hypothesis >= 3.59.1

For pre-processing:
- tensorflow >= 1.11
- docopt >= 0.6.2
- pyspark >= 2.3.0
- unidecode >= 1.0.22
- inflect >= 1.0.1

### Install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparing data

Pre-process phase generates source and target files in TFRecord format, list containing keys to identify each samples, and hyper parameters.
The source and target files have `.source.tfrecord` and `.target.tfrecord` extension respectively.
The list file is named as `list.csv`. You have to split `list.csv` into `train.csv`, `validation.csv`, and `test.csv`.
Hyper parameters are generated in `hparams.json`. Th important parameters are `average_mel_level_db` and `stddev_mel_level_db`. 
These parameters can be used to normalize spectrogram at training time.

Example configurations for VCTK and LJSpeech can be found in `examples/vctk` and `examples/ljspeech`.


For VCTK, after downloading the corpus, run the following commands.
We recommend to store source and target files separately. You can use `--source-only` and `--target-only` option to do that.

```bash
bazel run preprocess_vctk -- --source-only --hparam-json-file=self-attention-tacotron/examples/vctk/self-attention-tacotron.json /path/to/VCTK-Corpus  /path/to/source/output/dir
bazel run preprocess_vctk -- --target-only --hparam-json-file=self-attention-tacotron/examples/vctk/self-attention-tacotron.json /path/to/VCTK-Corpus  /path/to/target/output/dir
```

For LJSpeech, run the following commands.

```bash
bazel run preprocess_ljspeech -- --source-only --hparam-json-file=self-attention-tacotron/examples/ljspeech/self-attention-tacotron.json /path/to/LJSpeech-1.1  /path/to/source/output/dir
bazel run preprocess_ljspeech -- --target-only --hparam-json-file=self-attention-tacotron/examples/ljspeech/self-attention-tacotron.json /path/to/LJSpeech-1.1  /path/to/target/output/dir
```


## Training

Training script conducts training and validation. 
Validation starts at a certain steps passed. You can control the steps to start validation by setting `save_checkpoints_steps`.
We do not support tensorflow below version 1.11, because behavior of training and validation is different.

`examples` contains configurations for two models: *Self-attention Tacotron* and *baseline Tacotron*.
You can find the configuration files for each model at `self-attention-tacotron.json` and `tacotron.json`.

You can run training by the following command, as an example for Self-attention Tacotron with VCTK dataset.

```bash
bazel run train -- --source-data-root=/path/to/source/output/dir --target-data-root=/path/to/target/output/dir --checkpoint-dir=/path/to/save/checkpoints --selected-list-dir=self-attention-tacotron/examples/vctk --hparam-json-file=self-attention-tacotron/examples/vctk/self-attention-tacotron.json
```

At validation phase, predicted alignments and spectrogram are generated in the checkpoint directory.

You can see summaries like loss value with `tensorboard`. 
Please check `loss_with_teacher` and `mel_loss_with_teacher` for validation metrics.
*xxx_with_teacher* means it is calculated with teacher forcing. 
Since alignment of ground truth and predicted spectrogram does not match normally, reliable metrics are ones with teacher forcing.


## Prediction

You can predict spectrogram with a trained model by the following command, as an example for LJSpeech dataset.

```bash
bazel run predict_mel -- --source-data-root=/path/to/source/output/dir --target-data-root=/path/to/target/output/dir --checkpoint-dir=/path/to/save/checkpoints --output-dir=/path/to/output/results --selected-list-dir=self-attention-tacotron/examples/vctk --hparam-json-file=self-attention-tacotron/examples/ljspeech/self-attention-tacotron.json
```

There are files with `.mfbsp` extension among generated files.
These files are compatible with @TonyWangX 's [WaveNet](https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/project-CURRENNT-public).
You can find an instruction for waveform inversion with the WaveNet [here](./WaveNet.md).

### Force alignment mode

Force alignment enables to calculate alignment from ground truth spectrogram and use it for predicting spectrogram.

You can use force alignment mode by specifying `use_forced_alignment_mode=True` as *hparams*. 
The following example enables force alignment mode by replacing *hparams* with `--hparams=use_forced_alignment_mode=True`.

```bash
bazel run predict_mel -- --source-data-root=/path/to/source/output/dir --target-data-root=/path/to/target/output/dir --checkpoint-dir=/path/to/save/checkpoints --output-dir=/path/to/output/results --selected-list-dir=self-attention-tacotron/examples/vctk --hparams=use_forced_alignment_mode=True --hparam-json-file=self-attention-tacotron/examples/ljspeech/self-attention-tacotron.json
```


## Running tests

```bash
bazel test //:all --force_python=py3 
```
